        <h1>Sea Otters</h1>
        <p>Sea otters are a keystone species, meaning their role in their environment has a greater effect than other species. 
            As top predators, sea otters are critical to maintaining the balance of nearshore ecosystems, such as kelp forests, embayments and estuaries.
            Without sea otters, sea urchins can overpopulate the sea floor and devour the kelp forests that provide cover and food for many other marine animals.
            By maintaining healthy kelp forests, sea otters also indirectly help to reduce levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a prevalent greenhouse gas,
            as kelp absorbs and sequesters carbon.</p><br>

            <p>Hunted to near extinction in the 18th and 19th centuries, sea otters finally gained protections with the signing of the International Fur Seal 
            Treaty of 1911. In the 1970s, they received additional safeguarding under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. Worldwide,
            sea otters have slowly recovered but still stand far below their historical population numbers. While sea otters are vulnerable to natural 
            environmental changes, their populations are significantly impacted by several human factors as well.</p>
