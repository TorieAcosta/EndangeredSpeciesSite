        <h1>What are Endangered Species?</h1>
        <p>An endangered species is an animal or plant that's considered at risk of extinction. A species can be listed as endangered 
            at the state, federal, and international level. On the federal level, the endangered species list is managed under the 
            Endangered Species Act.</p>
        <h2>How Many Animals are Currently Endangered?</h2>
        <p>You may be wondering: How many animals are endangered, or what animals are endangered in 2020? For the most recent version 
            of the list, IUCN researchers and scientists evaluated 63,837 species. Of that number, 19,817 are threatened with extinction; 
            3,947 landed in the Critically Endangered category; 5,766 qualified as Endangered, and over 10,000 species are listed under 
            Vulnerable.</p>
        <h2>What is the Endangered Species Act?</h2>
        <p>The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted by Congress in 1973. Under the ESA, the federal government has the responsibility
           to protect endangered species (species that are likely to become extinct throughout all or a large portion of their range), 
           threatened species (species that are likely to become endangered in the near future), and critical habitat (areas vital to the
           survival of endangered or threatened species).
            
           The Endangered Species Act has lists of protected plant and animal species both nationally and worldwide. When a species is 
           given ESA protection, it is said to be a "listed" species. Many additional species are evaluated for possible protection under 
           the ESA, and they are called “candidate” species.</p>
