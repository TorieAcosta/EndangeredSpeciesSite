        <h1>Wildlife is Suffering</h1>
        <p> Wildlife on planet Earth is under siege from all sides, facing down habitat loss and the impact of climate change. 
            Some of the biggest threats to wildlife include illegal wildlife trade, habitat destruction, invasive species, pollution, 
            and clime change.</p><br>
            
            <p>Illegal Wildlife Trade: The illegal wildlife trade is the fourth largest criminal industry in the world, after drugs, arms, 
            and human trafficking. Gathering in over $US20 billion a year, it is also one of the biggest threats to some of the most iconic 
            species on the planet, like the rhino and the elephant.</p> 
            
            <p>Habitat Destruction: The fires that swept across the Amazon and Australia rightly drew attention to just how fragile the most 
            important ecosystems are. Half of the worldâ€™s original forests are gone, and what remains is being cut down ten times faster 
            than it can be replaced.</p>

            <p>Invasive Species: Whether accidentally or intentionally introduced, the non-native species grow and reproduce rapidly, then 
            spread across ecosystems aggressively. They are one of the leading threats to native wildlife, putting 42% of threatened or 
            endangered species at risk.</p> 
            
            <p>Pollution: There are 500 times more pieces of microplastic in the sea than there are stars in our galaxy. Eight hundred million 
            tonnes of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year, washing up on previously pristine parts of the planet and is a threat to the 
            survival of more than 600 species of marine wildlife.</p>

            <img src="images/climatechange.jpg" alt="Climate Change">
           

            <p>Climate Change: From more regular and fiercer storms to more prolonged and more intense droughts, the impact of climate change is 
            rising ocean temperatures and diminishing Arctic sea ice affecting marine biodiversity, shifting vegetation zones and forcing species 
            to adapt to new conditions.</p> 

            <p>The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very 
            foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health, and quality of life worldwide.</p>
