        <h1>How You Can Help</h1>
        <p>Public awareness and education must play an essential part in teaching an environment of compassion in protecting 
            animals with sustainable solutions to address these issues. All these need to be discussed collectively at a global 
            scale to make a positive impact. In addition to this, we need to be mindful of tackling increased urbanization, rising 
            temperatures, and ecotourism, which are negatively contributing and fueling to affect wildlife.</p><br> 
            
            <p>Dramatic urbanization has led species living in urban environments to develop differently from their non-urban counterparts.
            In the last 50 years, the global average temperature has risen at 170 times, having dangerous effects on wildlife populations.
            Although ecotourism can help to raise awareness of wildlife, it has severe adverse effects like chronic stress and decreased 
            immune systems. The scale of the problem is multifaceted; as individuals, we can strive to lower the carbon footprint and 
            urge governments to help make our countries greener.</p>
